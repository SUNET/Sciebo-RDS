If you would like to contribute, there are several different possibilities.

## Translations

You can make the fastest contribution with the translation. If you find an error in one of the translations of the software, you can make a change on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/university-of-munster/sciebo-rds/), which we will check and if necessary take over.

In the following graphic you can see which languages still need your support. If you can't find a language you know, please contact us at Github / E-Mail / Transifex.
