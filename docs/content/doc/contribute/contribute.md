If you would like to contribute, there are several different possibilities.

## Translations

You can make the fastest contribution with the translation. If you find an error in one of the translations of the software, you can make a change on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/university-of-munster/sciebo-rds/), which we will check and if necessary take over.

## Developments

If you have programming skills or want to help with the programming work, you can also use the [Github-Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to place a pull request on the platform. We will then look at your changes and accept them if they meet the following criteria. You can also find ideas and help on Github in the [Issues](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/issues).
