# Owncloud

## Installation

### via source

Please refer to the [Configuring Owncloud](../../../gettingstarted/ocplugin.md) page of our Getting Started guide to see, how you can install the plugin through source.

### via Marketplace

Install the [plugin](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/rds) from the marketplace. This version will probably not be as up-to-date as the releases provided by our release page.

## Configuration

Please refer to the [Configuring Owncloud](../../../gettingstarted/ocplugin.md) page of our Getting Started guide to see, how you have to configure the plugin via the admin UI.

### Commandline

In advance, you can use the `occ` command to configure the plugin without the need to go to admin UI. The command `occ rds` shows all commands related to sciebo RDS within the plugin. The help-texts should be enough to figure out, what they do.
This commands are very handy for setup scripts.
