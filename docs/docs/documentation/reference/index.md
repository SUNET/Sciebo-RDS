# Reference

This Reference serves two purposes:
1. The *Glossary* is supposed give you a deeper understanding of the language used in the context of the Sciebo RDS project. If you come across a term and you aren't quite sure how it is meant in the project's context, have a look at the Glossary. If the Glossary doesn't hold an explanation for your term, please [contact us](mailto:sciebo.rds@uni-muenster.de) or open a [Github](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/issues) Issue so we can add it to the list.
2. The *ARC42* architecture definition. [Arc42](https://arc42.org/) is a standadized way to document software architecture.
