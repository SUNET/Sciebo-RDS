# Monorepo

We use a monorepo to make it easier to track related changes. This means that you will find all relevant files in a single [Github repository](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS).

The following table will give an impression of the individual services. If you want to contribute, follow this structure. We will create an additional repository for community provided connectors, where you can develop your own. 

| Folder           | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| /charts          | Helm charts                          |
| /docs            | Website with documentation           |
| /getting-started | Files for easy deployment            |
| /RDS             | The code for the connector services. |
| /                | Metafiles and configuration          |
