# Contribute to documentation

The whole documentation was written in markdown and can be found in the Git repository in the `/docs` folder. It uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to generate a static html page. All markdown files are stored in `/docs/docs` (no, this is not misspelled :)).

Feel free to add your text, correct typos and add images. We are always happy to see your contribution.
