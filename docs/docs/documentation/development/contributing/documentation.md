# Contributing to the Documentation

The documentation is written in markdown and can be found in the Github repository (see the `/docs` [folder](https://github.com/Sciebo-RDS/Sciebo-RDS/tree/develop/docs)). We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to generate static html pages. All documentation related markdown files are stored in `/docs/docs` (no, that is not a typo :)).

Feel free to extend existing documentation, contribute your own texts, correct typos and add images. We are always thankful for contributions.
