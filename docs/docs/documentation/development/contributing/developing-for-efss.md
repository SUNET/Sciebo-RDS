# Developing an EFSS plugin

When implementing a new service for Layer 2 or 3, you have to create your own plugin or adapt an existing one. All available plugins can be found in the Git repository. The services in Layer 1 (the ports layer) are automatically provided tokens by the token storage, which is connected to the Research Manager and used by the Metadata and Exporter Service.

Select a plugin (e.g. Owncloud) and see the integration. (Owncloud itself offers a Developer Manual.)
