# Update Kubernetes

First, you need to update the helm repository with `helm repo up`. Then you can rerun the same command as before: `helm upgrade -i sciebords -f values.yaml sciebords/all`.

# Update ownCloud

If you install the plugin through the marketplace, you already should know how to update. But if you installed it manually, you should take a look to the ownCloud setup page as before and rerun the process to update the plugin.
