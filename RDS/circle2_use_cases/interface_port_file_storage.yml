        Returns all files and folders within filepath, if it is a folder. Otherwise the array is empty.

        The paths needs to be absolute, so the user can request the returned elements without any string modifcations.
        Folders are marked with slash / at the end. Files does not have this slash. 
        The lookup for files and folders is not recursive. The user make a request by himself for the recursive folder lookup for your returned array.
